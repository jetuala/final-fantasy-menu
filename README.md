Hello!

This is my attempt at recreating the classic Menu screen from the Final Fantasy video game series.

This app uses moogleAPI (moogleapi.com), a RESTful API developed by Jack F Perry Jr., to create a "party" of up to 5 characters from the Final Fantasy series.

About This Project
--------

On the Main screen, you can see some basic details of each party member. On the Party screen, you can add or delete party members, as well as search for new party members from moogleAPI. You can also rearrange the party by dragging and dropping. On the Status screen, you can see additional details of each party member. On the Config screen, you can change the window color using a Color Picker from the react-color dependency.

The technologies I used in this project are as follows:

React
React-Router
React-Redux
Redux Toolkit
react-dnd
react-color

Unfortunately, I've been running into some bugs with react-dnd that I'm not exactly sure how to fix, and I think this project is close enough to completion that I don't want to devote any more extra time to it. If you have any suggestions that would help, please send them my way!!

What I Learned
--------

Plenty! How to manage local/global states with Redux, simplifying actions/reducers with Toolkit, incorporating 3rd party dependencies with dnd & color, and continuing work with CSS Grid. I also learned how to manage my temper through meditation and copious amounts of temple-rubbing.

About Me
--------

I am a freelance musician from the Las Vegas, NV, USA area, hoping to secure employment in front-end web development in the next few months. I have played piano for over 30 years, but the fragmented schedule of a musician has started to wear me down. I am excited to learn, grow, and help people out in new and unique ways!

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
